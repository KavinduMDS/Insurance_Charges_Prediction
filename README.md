This project predicts insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. I used a dataset where the average insurance charge is 13,270.42. The model was trained using both regression and neural networks, and evaluated with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3,212.29, meaning the predictions are off by about this amount on average. The goal is to provide a model that can predict insurance charges with reasonable accuracy for new data.
